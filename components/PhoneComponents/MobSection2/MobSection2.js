                        We are living in a time when the Earth is losing wildlife and wild places faster than any time in the last 3 million years. If we maintain this path, wild species and their unique habitats will disappear forever. Currently, wildlife in conflict with humans are often killed or their habitat destroyed in an attempt to prevent the conflicts or simply because communities donâ€™t have the resources to stop it. It is the primary threat to wildlife on a global scale
